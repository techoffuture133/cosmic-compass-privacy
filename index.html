  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Cosmic Compass</h2>

  <p><strong>Last updated: January 22, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>
    Cosmic Compass is a paid mobile application available as a one-time purchase on the Google Play Store.  
    The app does not contain advertisements, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Cosmic Compass.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Google Sign-In Authentication</h2>
  <p>
    This app uses <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> for user authentication. When you sign in with your Google account, we request and receive the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Name (first and last)</li>
    <li>Profile picture</li>
    <li>Google User ID</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is used <strong>exclusively</strong> for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>User authentication (logging you in securely)</li>
    <li>Personalizing your experience (e.g., displaying your zodiac sign and tailored daily guidance)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="highlight">
    The app requests only the minimum necessary OAuth scopes: <strong>email</strong> and <strong>profile</strong>.<br>
    Your data is <strong>not stored on our servers</strong> – it is kept temporarily in your device's local memory during your active session only.<br>
    When you log out or close the app, all Google Sign-In data is automatically removed from the app's memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information on how Google handles your data, please see:  
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond the Google Sign-In information described above, we do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any other personal data. We do not track your location, browsing habits, device identifiers, or any other information.
  </p>
  <p>
    User preferences such as your zodiac sign and birthday (if you choose to provide them) are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> (using localStorage) to personalize your daily readings. These preferences are not sent to any server and are not shared with anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not use analytics tools, tracking SDKs, advertising services, or any third-party data processors.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Sign-In data: stored only during your active session. Deleted automatically on logout or app closure.</li>
    <li>Local preferences (zodiac sign, birthday): remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not retain any personal data on servers.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with any third parties, except for Google as part of their OAuth authentication process (governed by Google's privacy policy).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    All payments are processed securely and exclusively by Google Play. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or any financial data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA / Other Privacy Laws)</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revoke access</strong>: You can revoke the app's access to your Google account at any time by visiting <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a></li>
    <li><strong>Access your data</strong>: Contact us to request a copy of any data we may have temporarily processed</li>
    <li><strong>Delete your data</strong>: Logging out removes session data; clearing app data removes local preferences</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Cosmic Compass is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use industry-standard security measures to protect the temporary data stored in your device's memory.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on this page. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
