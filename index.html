<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass is a paid mobile application available as a one-time purchase on the Google Play Store.
  The app does not contain advertisements, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
  The data controller for this application is the developer of Cosmic Compass.
</p>

<h2>2. Google Sign-In Authentication</h2>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass uses <strong>Sign in with Google</strong> for user authentication.
</p>
<p>
  When you sign in with your Google account, the following information may be accessed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>First and last name</li>
  <li>Profile picture</li>
  <li>Google User ID</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This information is used solely for authentication purposes and basic personalization within the app.
</p>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass does not store this data on its own servers. Authentication is handled by Google,
  and the data is used locally within the app during the active session only.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about how Google processes your data, please visit:<br />
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    https://policies.google.com/privacy
  </a>
</p>

<h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
  Apart from the Google Sign-In data described above, Cosmic Compass does not collect, store,
  or transmit any personal data.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does not track location</li>
  <li>Does not use analytics tools</li>
  <li>Does not use tracking SDKs</li>
  <li>Does not display ads</li>
  <li>Does not collect usage or behavioral data</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Optional user preferences (such as zodiac sign or birthday, if provided) are stored locally
  on the user’s device only to personalize daily content.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
  Google Sign-In authentication data is used only during the active app session.
</p>
<p>
  When you log out or close the app, authentication data is removed from the app’s local memory.
  Locally stored preferences can be removed by logging out, resetting the app, or uninstalling the application.
</p>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass does not retain personal data on any external servers.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass does not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.
</p>
<p>
  The only third party involved is Google, as part of the Google Sign-In OAuth authentication process,
  which is governed by Google’s own privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>6. Payments</h2>
<p>
  All payments are processed exclusively through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass does not have access to credit card numbers, payment details, or billing information.
</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA)</h2>
<p>
  Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revoke access to your Google account via Google Account permissions</li>
  <li>Request information about the data used by the app</li>
  <li>Remove locally stored data by logging out or uninstalling the app</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Because Cosmic Compass does not store personal data on external servers,
  no server-side data deletion is required.
</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Cosmic Compass is not intended for children under the age of 13.
  The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected within the app and/or this document.
</p>
<p>
  Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
</p>
